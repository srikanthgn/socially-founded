I'm continuing SociallyFounded atomic architecture development.

CURRENT STATUS: Google authentication working perfectly, atomic component architecture proven successful. Ready to build LinkedIn and Email auth components next.

CONTEXT: Entrepreneur-focused platform with Firebase backend, atomic service architecture (50-line components), OpenAI integration ready.

TECHNICAL STATUS:
- ✅ Homepage loading atomic components: https://sociallyfounded.com/
- ✅ Google Auth working: /components/authentication/google-auth/
- ✅ Welcome page with logout: https://sociallyfounded.com/welcome/
- ✅ Firebase + Component Loader operational
- ✅ SF Passport ID system working (SF-XXXXXXX-XX format)

IMMEDIATE GOAL: Build LinkedIn Auth atomic component at /components/authentication/linkedin-auth/

ARCHITECTURE: Follow atomic principles - single responsibility, 50-line services, independent loading, AI-friendly debugging.

BRAND: Poppins font, Navy (#003554), Gold (#D4AF37), White (#FFFFFF), 40px logo.

Please help me create the LinkedIn authentication atomic component (HTML + JS) following the same pattern as the working Google Auth component.
